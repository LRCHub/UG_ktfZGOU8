Four million, three thousand, two hundred
Twenty-one tear-ears from now-ow-ow-ow

I fell in love with you (fell in love, fell in love with you)
In less than a minute
I opened up my heart (opened up, opened up my heart)
And put you right in i-i-i-i-it

Your sweet love somehow-ow-ow

Oh everybody said (everbody, everybody said)
That downhills are sorrow-ow-ow
And there'll be someone else (there'll be some, there'll be someone else)
A brighter tomorrow-ow-ow-ow-ow
But lovin' you so much (lovin' you, lovin' you so much)
I just don't see how-ow-ow
Maybe four million, three thousand, two hundred
Twenty-one tears from now

Four million, three thousand, two hundred
Twenty-one tear-ears from now-ow-ow-ow
Maybe I'll forget, that we ever me-e-e-e-et [fade]
